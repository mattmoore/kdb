# KDB

I was previously a Scala engineer - and I miss that language dearly. Now that I'm working in Kotlin, I'm appalled at the lack of a good functional database mapper for PostgreSQL. I dislike ORMs, loved Doobie with Scala, so I got inspired to write my own database library for Kotlin, inspired largely by Doobie.
